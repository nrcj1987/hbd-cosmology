# Hyperbolic Brane Dynamics (HBD) Cosmology

A Python implementation of the Hyperbolic Brane Dynamics cosmological model, featuring geometric dark energy and distinctive CMB signatures from hyperboloid brane embedding.

## Key Features

- **Geometric Dark Energy**: From hyperboloid brane extrinsic curvature
- **CMB Anomalies**: Low-ℓ suppression, mid-ℓ wiggles, B-mode peak
- **String Theory Inspired**: Warped throat geometry with flux stabilization
- **Falsifiable Predictions**: Testable with CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hbd-cosmology
cd hbd-cosmology
pip install -e .
